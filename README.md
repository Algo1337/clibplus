 <h1>C Mixed System Standard Lib Extension</h1>
 <p>A complete system built-in mixed standard C library package using the minimial libraries that comes with just about any linux OS</p>
</div>

# About

This is a package that extend the minimum linux built-in packages to abstract low-level functions. View the list of included libraries for more information.
Please note that using this package can increase binary size due to certain libs being used within each-other. Which wouldn't be any difference from using a higher-level language. If you aren't creating application that will proform protection check-sum operation and need better proformance.

<b>Why?</b>

To avoid re-inventing the wheels for future projects and to attract more developer to move to C and have to start with that isn't gonna kill their motivation in the process of learning when approaching memory management

# Coming Soon

- An application serving as a github-based repo package manager. Allowing you to download certain libs from this repo from linux CMD-Line (ex: ctypes -i net -extra)
