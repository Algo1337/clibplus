# About

This is a package that extend the minimum linux built-in packages to abstract low-level functions. View the list of included libraries for more information.
Please note that using this package can increase binary size due to certain libs being used within each-other. Which wouldn't be any difference from using a higher-level language. If you aren't creating application that will proform protection check-sum operation and better proformance.

<b>Why?</b>

To avoid re-inventing the wheels for future projects and to absract more developer to move to C and have to start with that isn't gonna kill their motivation in the process of learning
